## Description
A proyect to practice react reactivity building the Abalone board game.
See deployment at sebs.alwaysdata.net

### Comments.
Started as a react JS proyect using create-react-app, moved to Typescript & Vite.

### Cube Coordinates.
Just implemented a second set of coordinate systems - cube coordinates - for the board to be able to be reference as a hezagonal grid. This will help ease the implementation of different algorithms for the balls functionability. Now a ball can be reference by its position on the array and by its cubic coordinates.
